### 5. OrchestratorAgent (Coordination Engine)

**Purpose**: Manages workflow execution and inter-agent communication
**AI Model Used**: None (pure coordination logic)

#### **Workflow Templates**

**1. Full Pipeline**
```
IdeaCoach → ValidationAgent → ProductManagerAgent
```

**2. Idea Generation Only**
```
IdeaCoach
```

**3. Validation Only**
```
ValidationAgent
```

**4. PRD Creation Only**
```
ProductManagerAgent
```

#### **Session Management**

**Session Lifecycle**:
1. **Creation**: Initialize session with unique ID
2. **Context Storage**: Maintain workflow state and results
3. **Agent Coordination**: Route tasks to appropriate agents
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor execution status
5. **Result Aggregation**: Combine agent outputs
6. **Session Persistence**: Store for future reference

**Session Data Structure**:
```json
{
  "session_id": "unique-identifier",
  "created_at": "timestamp",
  "workflow_type": "full_pipeline",
  "current_stage": "validation",
  "workflow_history": [
    {
      "agent": "idea_coach",
      "status": "completed",
      "result": {...}
    }
  ],
  "results": {
    "ideas": [...],
    "validations": [...],
    "prd": {...}
  }
}
```

#### **Coordination Logic**:
```python
async def _execute_workflow(workflow_type, task_data, session):
    workflow_steps = self.workflow_templates[workflow_type]
    
    for step in workflow_steps:
        # Execute agent-specific logic
        if step["agent"] == "idea_coach":
            result = await self._execute_idea_generation_step(...)
        elif step["agent"] == "validator":
            result = await self._execute_validation_step(...)
        elif step["agent"] == "product_manager":
            result = await self._execute_prd_creation_step(...)
        
        # Store results for next agent
        session[f"{step['agent']}_results"] = result
    
    return aggregated_results
```

## Inter-Agent Communication Patterns

### 1. **Sequential Processing**
- Each agent processes results from the previous agent
- Data flows through the pipeline: Ideas → Validation → PRD
- Session state maintains context between agents

### 2. **Shared Memory Architecture**
- Session object serves as shared memory
- All agents can access previous results
- Orchestrator manages data flow and consistency

### 3. **Async Execution**
- All agents use async/await patterns
- Non-blocking operations enable scalability
- Performance metrics tracked for optimization

## Error Handling and Resilience

### **Agent-Level Error Handling**
- Each agent wraps execution in try/catch blocks
- Graceful degradation when AI calls fail
- Status updates reflect error states

### **Orchestrator-Level Recovery**
- Workflow continues even if individual agents fail
- Partial results returned when possible
- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints for critical failures

### **Performance Monitoring**
- Real-time agent status tracking
- Success rate calculations
- Response time monitoring
- Automatic metrics collection

## Scalability Considerations

### **Horizontal Scaling**
- Stateless agent design enables multiple instances
- Session-based architecture supports load distribution
- Independent agent scaling based on demand

### **Performance Optimization**
- Async execution prevents blocking
- Caching strategies for repeated prompts
- Resource pooling for AI client connections

### **Monitoring and Observability**
- Real-time status endpoints
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and alerting

## Future Extensions

### **Additional Agents**
- **MarketingAgent**: Campaign strategy and content creation
- **DesignAgent**: UI/UX mockups and design systems
- **FinanceAgent**: Detailed financial modeling and projections

### **Enhanced Coordination**
- **Parallel Processing**: Run multiple agents simultaneously
- **Dynamic Workflows**: Adaptive agent selection based on context
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Interactive decision points

### **Advanced Features**
- **Multi-Model Support**: Different AI models for different tasks
- **Learning System**: Agent improvement based on feedback
- **Integration APIs**: Connect with external tools and services
